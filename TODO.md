# To Do List
- allow rollback so client player always gets a hit (but ensure it is possible to set a limit of say 500ms)
- do damage color flash until damage number is received from server
- ensure damage does not show up before attacks for other players
- Move game abilities, GAS, ASC etc. over to the client code as well
- Tidy ServerMessage messages to allow for different message receipts
- Make dash and attack anims show on other players screen
- Develop system that handles server events e.g. NPC attacks
    event handling as it happens or event flags in gameObjects?
